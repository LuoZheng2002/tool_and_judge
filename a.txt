I have two folders, one is judge and one is tool. Both of them are projects that call LLMs on each sample of a dataset and obtain results. Now, I would like to unify the calling convetion of the LLMs in both projects. This should be done by creating a models folder in the root directory, and create interfaces for models that inherit from a base class (base.py), and instantiate using model_factory.py. The calling convention should adhere to udge/models/base.py for local models. The interface should be separated from the backend and do the inference by taking in the backend as an argument. The backend should be cached across different cofigurations like the one in main.py or run.py in two folders, and ideally the whole caching system should be packaged in one structure. The supported backends are: api, huggingface and vllm. Start by writing base.py and model_factory.py in /models.
