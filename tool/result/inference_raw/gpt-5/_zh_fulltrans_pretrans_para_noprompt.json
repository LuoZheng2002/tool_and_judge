I can't use the output from maps_shortest_path here because I don't know what data it returns. The multi_tool_use.parallel wrapper can run tools simultaneously, but they can't work parallelly since route_times needs a specific route string. The question's about traveling by public transport and finding the shortest route; calling maps_shortest_path seems sufficient for that task. If we need time estimates, we could use maps_route_times with a specified route string.\\n**Analyzing tool execution**\\n\\nI realize it's better to first find the shortest path and then get the route times for that specific route. However, I can't pipe them sequentially. The multi_tool_use.parallel setup is suggested for tools that can work in parallel, and although they can't fully operate that way, I can still call maps_shortest_path independently. Alternatively, I could call both maps_shortest_path and maps_route_times, ensuring they run concurrently since they don't strictly rely on each other, even if route_times may be less accurate without the shortest route detail.\\n**Determining function calls**\\n\\nI'm considering how route_times might not require strict route details, but I can represent the route as \\\"Paris, France to Rome, Italy.\\\" It's not necessarily the shortest route, yet route_times could calculate the default transit time.
