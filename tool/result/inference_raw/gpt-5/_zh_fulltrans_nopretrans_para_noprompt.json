I should explain that the question lacks the necessary parameters for a function call since it doesn't specify item, material, or size.

However, it's clearer just to state that none of the functions can be used, as there\\u2019s no function to list materials. The \\\"multi_tool_use.parallel\\\" suggests using tools simultaneously, but that doesn't apply here since none fit.
