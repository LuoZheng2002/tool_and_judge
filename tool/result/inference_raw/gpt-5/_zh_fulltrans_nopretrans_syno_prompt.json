There's a tool available for this, requiring integer arrays for both points. The optional rounding isn't specified by the user; the default is 0, which may not reflect the most accurate result. Although I want to avoid rounding to 0 decimals, if I don't specify, it defaults to that. Ideally, I'd prefer not to round.\\n**Calculating distance and rounding**\\n\\nI\\u2019m computing the distance using the formula: sqrt((3-1)^2 + (4-2)^2), which simplifies to 2*sqrt(2) or about 2.828427. If I round to 0 decimals, I get 3, but that's not accurate. Ideally, I should specify rounding, maybe to 6 decimals, since the tool defaults to 0. Although rounding wasn't specified by the user, aiming for higher precision might be best. However, since the user's request is just for distance, I should stick to calling the EuclideanDistance_calculate function.\\n**Setting rounding for calculations**\\n\\nI\\u2019m thinking of setting the rounding to maybe 6. But wait, is there a rule for that? The developer instruction indicates I should make function calls based on the user's question or note any missing parameters. If I don\\u2019t include the rounding field, it defaults to 0, which would inaccurately return 3 instead of the true distance of about 2.828.

That usually means I would present results in natural language afterward, yet here it seems I'm limited to just function calls.

Maybe a two-step process could clarify the situation?\\n**Handling case status checks**\\n\\nI see there\\u2019s no tool to fetch case details without the closed_status check. The function \\\"lawsuit_check_case\\\" claims it can check status using the case ID, but it insists on a boolean, which feels tricky. The user specifically asked to confirm if the case is closed. I\\u2019m considering calling the function twice\\u2014once with closed_status set to true and once to false\\u2014to compare the results. However, I must remember to only return function calls without an explanation since that's what the system requires.\\n**Exploring function behavior**\\n\\nI\\u2019m considering how the tool works: it seems to return case details and status, regardless of the closed_status parameter. I assume it checks the status against the boolean I provide. Since the user specifically asked for confirmation, I\\u2019m thinking of setting closed_status to true, but if it's actually false, that could cause a mismatch. An alternative would be to run the function twice\\u2014once with true and once with false\\u2014to get results for comparison. However, I can only return function calls without any additional comparison in my response.\\n**Deciding on function calls**\\n\\nI realize I can use multi_tool_use.parallel to run both calls, but maybe that's not necessary. Given the uncertainty with the boolean, I think it\\u2019s safer to just call with case_id 1234 and set closed_status to true. If it's wrong, the tool might return a mismatch. Since the user is looking for confirmation on whether it\\u2019s closed, passing closed_status as true feels appropriate. So, I\\u2019ll go ahead and call functions.lawsuit_check_case with case_id 1234 and closed_status true, sticking to the instruction to only return function calls.\\n\"}, {\"type\": \"function_call\", \"name\": \"lawsuit_check_case\", \"arguments\": \"{\\\"case_id\\\":1234,\\\"closed_status\\\":true}\", \"call_id\": \"call_TFBmgLm5UbvLkmTrBMv8A8cl\"}]}"}
