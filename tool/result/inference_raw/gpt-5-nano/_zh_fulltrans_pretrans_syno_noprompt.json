Even so, I should still be able to fetch rewards specific to the PlayStation for the missions listed. Lastly, I\\u2019m wondering how to handle default values for mission and trophy properly.\\n**Understanding mission and trophy defaults**\\n\\nThe tool description mentions that both \\\"mission\\\" and \\\"trophy level\\\" default to an empty string, which isn't clearly stated in the JSON. I could call the function using mission: \\\"\\\" and trophy: \\\"\\\" to get general info. It seems like the \\\"game_rewards_get\\\" function would provide details on various rewards in a game, accepting mission and trophy as optional. I just need to focus on making the relevant function calls based on the user's question.\\n**Pointing out function parameters**\\n\\nIf the question doesn\\u2019t have the parameters needed for the function, I should mention that. I must keep my response strictly to function calls without any explanations or direct answers. \\n\\nFor the user's inquiry about \\\"Fortnite\\\" rewards on \\\"PlayStation,\\\" I can use multi_tool_use.parallel to call game_missions_list for \\\"Fortnite\\\" and game_rewards_get with mission: \\\"\\\" and trophy: \\\"\\\" to gather general reward info. I might also want to consider various trophy levels like \\\"Bronze,\\\" \\\"Silver,\\\" \\\"Gold,\\\" \\\"Platinum,\\\" or \\\"Free Pass\\\" for thoroughness.\\n**Assessing game rewards structure**\\n\\nI see there are Season Pass tiers, probably related to \\\"Season X\\\" or \\\"Battle Pass\\\" rewards. The expectations from the function might not align with external systems. I could call game_rewards_get for \\\"Fortnite\\\" on \\\"PlayStation,\\\" using empty strings for mission and trophy to get general reward types, although that might yield different results. \\n\\nAlternatively, I could call game_missions_list to fetch mission names, then get rewards for each mission using game_rewards_get, but I can't loop programmatically. It might make sense to start with a single call for general rewards. The function does allow mission to default to an empty string.\\n**Preparing function calls in parallel**\\n\\nI think we can run two calls in parallel: first, I\\u2019ll use game_missions_list with \\\"Fortnite\\\" to get a list of missions; second, I\\u2019ll call game_rewards_get for \\\"Fortnite\\\" on \\\"PlayStation\\\" with mission and trophy set as empty strings to get a general overview of the rewards. \\n\\nI need to use multi_tool_use.parallel for these calls.
