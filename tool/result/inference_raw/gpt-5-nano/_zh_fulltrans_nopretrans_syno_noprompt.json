It feels odd to call it without parameters. Alternatively, I might consider running multiple tools simultaneously, but since I only need to calculate the average for a specific student\\u2019s scores, I\\u2019m thinking it may rely on an internal dataset instead.\\n**Considering function usage**\\n\\nI see that the instruction says I need to make function or tool calls to achieve the goal. There\\u2019s a mismatch since I could compute the average myself, but I can't answer directly. The function might not be necessary, so I need to focus on function calls instead. The user wants the average, and calling calculate_average without parameters wouldn't include John's scores. However, I wonder if I could use it with parameters since the signature shows none, even though the \\\"parallel\\\" tool allows for parallel calls with aligned parameters.\\n**Clarifying function calls**\\n\\nI'm focusing on the calculate_average function, and I see that the parameters could include either student_name like \\\"John\\\" or \\\"student_id,\\\" but the tool spec shows there are none. The instructions are a bit ambiguous since they define calculate_average as a function without parameters. Typically, I'd use relevant data, but I can't pass any in this case. Since we need the average, I feel we should stick with functions.calculate_average, which requires an empty input. After that, I guess I can present the answer, but right now I should only return function calls.\\n**Understanding function return instructions**\\n\\nI realize that typically, I'd call a function and then respond with results in natural language. However, the instruction is clear that I should only return function calls. It seems the pattern here is to call the function, and then I assume I present the results afterward.
