I think we should call the function first and then show the user the result in the following message. But the developer's instructions emphasize that no extra text or explanations should be included, which makes sense for delivering a forecast. It seems like using a commentary channel for the function call while saving the results for later is the way to go, even if the instructions are a bit confusing.\\n**Understanding function call instructions**\\n\\nI'm reflecting on how to handle these tasks. The usual method is to issue the function call in the \\\"commentary\\\" channel and wait for the function result. Then I\\u2019d post the actual forecast in the \\\"final\\\" channel. But that goes against the directive, which states that I should only return function calls without any extra text or explanations.

The directive is clear: I must use the tools without answering the question directly. So, the final answer can only be a function call message. I wonder how I'll deliver the forecast to the user. Maybe the system will display the function's result automatically after the invocation, which isn't typical. Usually, I would respond with a final answer, but I\\u2019m not sure if that\\u2019s how it will work here.\\n**Issuing function call for stock forecast**\\n\\nConsidering the constraints, it seems I just need to issue the function call, and then the system will automatically show the result to the user.
