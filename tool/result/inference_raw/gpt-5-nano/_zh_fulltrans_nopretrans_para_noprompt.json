If I set the final speed to 10, with a time of 4 and a distance of 20, it gives me an acceleration of 2.5. Everything checks out mathematically, and the distance condition holds too!\\n**Determining acceleration function**\\n\\nI need to compute acceleration, and I'm planning to use final speed set at 10.

I wonder if I should use multi_tool_use to calculate acceleration and something else. I can't set final speed at zero, since I don't know it.

{"id": "multiple_199", "result": "[{\"type\": \"reasoning\", \"content\": \"**Planning forest cover forecast**\\n\\nI need to focus on responding to a user query about forecasting forest cover changes in Yellowstone over the next five years and analyze human activity impacts. I have functions like `forest_growth_forecast(location, years, include_human_impact)`, which should help. The user wants both trend analysis and human impact information, so I'll set the `include_human_impact` parameter to true. The location will be \\\"Yellowstone National Park,\\\" and I'll ensure to use the appropriate tool for this task.\\n**Setting up tool call**\\n\\nI need to invoke the `forest_growth_forecast` function to forecast forest cover in Yellowstone National Park over the next five years, including the impact of human activities. First, I must send this tool call to the \\\"commentary\\\" channel. The parameters will be: location as \\\"Yellowstone National Park,\\\" years set to 5, and `include_human_impact` set to true. I think passing \\\"Yellowstone National Park\\\" as the location will work best, and then I'll execute the call to retrieve the data.\\n**Clarifying response guidelines**\\n\\nI need to remember that after invoking the function, the results will be presented in natural language. However, the instructions specify that my response should only include function calls. That means I can't add any explanations or direct answers in my response. It seems there\\u2019s a typical pattern where I call a function and later present results, but since I\\u2019m only allowed to return function calls now, I\\u2019ll strictly follow that guideline for this task.\\n**Following function call instructions**\\n\\nThe developer specifies that I should only return function calls in my response, which is different from the usual approach where I fetch data with tools and present results in the same message. It seems the instructions mean I should only focus on the function call for now. So, I\\u2019ll call the function and refrain from adding any natural language output. The system will handle the results, and I can\\u2019t present a final message yet.\\n**Preparing function call**\\n\\nGiven the instructions, I need to comply and proceed with a single function call. I\\u2019ll set it up for `functions.forest_growth_forecast` with the following parameters: the location as \\\"Yellowstone National Park,\\\" the duration set to 5 years, and `include_human_impact` set to true. I think this should provide the necessary data, so I'm ready to execute this function call now.
