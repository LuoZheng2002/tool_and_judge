I\\u2019m realizing I might need to compute the final speed before proceeding.\\n**Exploring speed calculation**\\n\\nI have an alternative function available, which calculates the speed of an object that starts from rest under constant acceleration over a distance. It requires parameters: distance, time, and initial speed, which defaults to 0. Since I know the initial speed is 0, the distance is 20 meters, and the time is 4 seconds, I realize this function can help compute the final speed after traveling that distance in the given time.
