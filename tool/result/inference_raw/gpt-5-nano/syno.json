So, I\\u2019ll get that function ready to execute!\\n**Clarifying the function call procedure**\\n\\nI realize I need to follow a specific instruction here: only return function calls in my response without any natural language content. So, I\\u2019ll call the function like this: functions.get_event_date({\\\"event\\\": \\\"Endorsement of the Treaty of Lisbon\\\"}). It\\u2019s a bit tricky because I won\\u2019t be able to provide a final answer right away. After the tool returns, though, the system expects a response in the final channel, where we\\u2019ll likely present the answer then. I\\u2019ll stick to just the function call for now!\\n**Following developer instructions on function calls**\\n\\nI see that the developer instruction is strict: I should only return function calls in my response. This means I won\\u2019t be able to present a natural language answer right now, even after the tool returns. The pattern usually allows for a textual response after getting the tool's result, but since the instruction is clear, I need to comply. I\\u2019ll simply issue the function call.
