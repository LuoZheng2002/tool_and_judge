I can't simply present the info, and proposing to choose materials isn't allowed either. I could create a function for a custom sculpture, but it wouldn't be appropriate without user confirmation. Maybe I should explore if there's a way to list materials, though there's no direct function for that.\\n**Interpreting user request**\\n\\nI see that the user asked about a \\\"Horse bronze sculpture\\\" in Chinese, which suggests they may already know they want bronze. They could be looking for available materials for finishing. The options include Bronze, Marble, Terracotta, Wood, and Stone, but I can't list these directly without a function call.

This isn\\u2019t ideal, but I could also consider using multi_tool_use.parallel to list available materials.\\n**Evaluating response options**\\n\\nI\\u2019m thinking about how to address the user's request without prematurely placing an order, which they didn\\u2019t ask for. It seems the system might expect a natural language response that lists materials, but I can't do that due to constraints. I could use the sculpture order tool to create a test piece for each option, but that would be placing unnecessary orders.

I could use \\\"sculpture_create_custom\\\" and set the material to \\\"Bronze\\\" while defaulting the size to 12, but that feels more like placing an order, which isn\\u2019t what they asked for. Given these constraints, I might consider creating multiple calls using the \\\"parallel\\\" tool for all material options, but that would create unnecessary orders. This feels tricky! I need to figure out the best way to respond without misrepresenting their request.\\n**Determining response strategies**\\n\\nThe user mentioned \\\"bronze,\\\" but their question is really about materials, which is a bit tricky. Yes, I could use that to create an order, but it wouldn\\u2019t address what they wanted. I could interpret it as them wanting options. To show available materials, I might consider creating multiple calls using \\\"multi_tool_use.parallel\\\" to produce 5 sculptures with different materials, but it technically creates orders.
