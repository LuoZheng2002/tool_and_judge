The object starts from rest and moves 20 meters in 4 seconds. The final speed can be calculated using constant acceleration. I\\u2019ll first determine the acceleration from the distance formula and then calculate the final speed. It can be computed with a tool that calculates acceleration, final speed, time, and distance. I\\u2019ll set up the function call now for accurate results!\\n**Choosing the right tool**\\n\\nI need to correctly calculate the speed of the object using the right tool since I have the distance, time, and know the initial speed is 0. The acceleration tool won't work since I can't provide the final speed, which I don't know yet. Instead, I'll use the function that calculates speed from rest, which is more appropriate for this situation. It takes distance, time, and initial speed, so it seems like the best choice! I'll set it up now.\\n**Understanding speed calculation**\\n\\nI see that the tool is designed to compute speed from rest based on distance and time. If we have those two variables, I can also calculate acceleration using the equation for constant acceleration, but the tool simplifies that for me.

However, the instructions clearly state that I can only return function calls in this response.
