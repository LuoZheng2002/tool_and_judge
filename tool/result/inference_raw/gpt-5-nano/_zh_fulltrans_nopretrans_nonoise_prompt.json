It seems that typically you would call a function, get a result, and then respond with the results in natural language. However, the instructions indicate that I should only return function calls without additional content. This feels a bit conflicting with what I might usually expect. I need to carefully follow these instructions to ensure I\\u2019m aligned with the developer\\u2019s guidelines.\\n**Clarifying function invocation**\\n\\nI need to ensure that if I invoke any functions, I\\u2019m strictly using the provided tools. Directly answering without them isn\\u2019t allowed, so the user\\u2019s final response should consist only of function calls. It feels unclear whether the system will handle the results. It seems like I'd send the function call in the \\\"commentary\\\" channel, and later the tool result will be shown as a separate message. But how does the final text fit into this workflow?

It states that tools are called in the \\\"commentary\\\" channel, while the \\\"final\\\" channel should be for the content presented to the user. However, the instruction tells me to return only function calls, which feels contradictory to the usual format. It seems that I should call the function in the commentary channel and then have the final message present the user's answer. This feels tricky, but I'm working through it.\\n**Making function calls**\\n\\nI'm reflecting on how previous tasks used the \\\"commentary\\\" channel for tool calls and then automatically returned results in the next step.
