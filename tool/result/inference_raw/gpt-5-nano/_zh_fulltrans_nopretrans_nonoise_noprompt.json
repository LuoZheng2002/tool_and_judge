Then there's another function that calculates speed from rest, which seems more applicable here as it requires distance and time and defaults the initial speed to zero.

If none of the functions fit, I should mention that. I could call the kinematics_calculate_acceleration function, but it needs a final speed, which I don't have. Instead, I can use the kinematics_calculate_speed_from_rest function with distance 20, time 4, and initial speed 0. By using the physics formulas, I can derive that the final speed should be 10 m/s.
