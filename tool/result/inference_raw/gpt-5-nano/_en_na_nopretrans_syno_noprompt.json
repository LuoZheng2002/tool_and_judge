Still, there\\u2019s no function to directly fetch options, which places me in a tricky position.\\n**Examining function responses**\\n\\nThe function is supposed to create an object, not simply return something as a read-only query.

Unfortunately, the sculpture_create_custom tool doesn\\u2019t allow for listing options directly in its parameters. It might return that Bronze is available, but that would not be very helpful. The usual approach when users ask about options is to provide that textually, but the instructions don\\u2019t allow that.

The function parameter constraints outline these options, but answering doesn't require a function call. However, the instruction is to provide only function calls.

The limitations are frustrating, and a straightforward textual answer about available materials\\u2014like Bronze, Marble, Terracotta, Wood, and Stone\\u2014would be much simpler.
