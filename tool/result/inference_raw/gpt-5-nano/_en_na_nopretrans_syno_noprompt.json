I\\u2019ll need to clarify the proper value to use based on that.\\n**Calculating magnetic field for a loop**\\n\\nTo determine the magnetic field at the center of a circular loop with radius R and current I, the formula is B = \\u03bc0 I / (2R). With \\u03bc0 approximately 4\\u03c0\\u00d710^-7 H/m, I can compute: B = (4\\u03c0\\u00d710^-7 * 5) / (2*4). Doing the math gives me around 7.85e-7 T.
