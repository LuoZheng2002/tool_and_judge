So, maybe I should suggest they consider ordering but focus on just the function call. I think I need a better approach to gather available options without jumping to order placement just yet.\\n**Analyzing sculpture tool limitations**\\n\\nI\\u2019m realizing that the sculpture_create_custom tool only returns information after an order is placed, which isn\\u2019t ideal for the user\\u2019s needs.
