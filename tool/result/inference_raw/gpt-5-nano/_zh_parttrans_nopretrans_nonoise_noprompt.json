It\\u2019s a bit confusing \\u2014 should I include the season integer in the call?\\n**Refining function call process**\\n\\nIn these calls, if the season is optional, we could omit it. The tool interface requires a JSON structure, but perhaps we can skip the \\\"season\\\" field. The signature indicates it's optional, so while I should include the necessary fields, I\\u2019ll only add \\\"team\\\" and \\\"league\\\" with \\\"Manchester United\\\" and \\\"Premier League.\\\" I'll call functions.sports_ranking without the season. My response must only include the function call, and after that, we'll present the result to the user.\\n**Following function call guidelines**\\n\\nThe developer's instruction is clear: I can only return function calls. I need to perform the function call first, and then once the tool returns a result, I can craft the final answer with the actual ranking. It looks like I\\u2019ll need to send the function call now without including any other text or explanations. The typical flow means I should call the tool, receive the results, and then share the answer in the next message. I'll proceed with that plan.\\n**Making the function call**\\n\\nI\\u2019m ready to call functions.sports_ranking with the following parameters: team set to \\\"Manchester United\\\" and league to \\\"Premier League.\\\" This should fulfill the request the user has made.
